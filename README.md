# ProjectsForLiberation

Projects for a more open society, participatory democracy, full transparency, etc.

Liberation from what? It is clear that our so-called "democracies" are, in fact, oligarchal and coercive in nature. This repository will act as an index for projects that seek to build democratic people's power over private interest groups which rule our world.

All projects live in [this trello board](https://trello.com/b/2pETMHrd) before they are built on github.

## Diagram of Power

A collaborative diagram to identify power structures. An investigative journalism tool.

## Demands Progress Tracker

To track the progress of popular demands. A pipeline from ideas to legislation. Visualize milestones, obstacles, possible pathways, alternatives, etc.

Gantt chart interface, horizontal timeline interface with branching and color coding.

## Automate All Jobs

In order to abolish wage slavery and to reach a better stage of human society, we should automate our jobs. This tool will be used to map out all tasks and processes involved with each job, so we can reduce human labor.

Solutions to mass unemployment will be be considered only after sufficent unemployment is reached. Proposed soutions include a universal income (UBI) and democratic command of the economy, abolition of profit, and moneyless post-scarcity society.

Solutions can be facilitated with the above "Demands Progress Tracker".

## Cost vs. Price Analysis

Cost analaysis of every consumer product to visualize industrial inefficiencies. We can optimize those inefficencies, reduce waste, and reduce corporate profits. Visualizing profits and inefficiencies will allow us to reduce the cost of consumer products.

## Democratically Planned Economy

A modern reincarnation of Chile's [Project Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn) which, ideally, will be led by [we, the people](https://youtu.be/e_bXlEvygHg?t=4m5s). (watch until 4:30: "ah yes, at last, system 5, the people")

## Map to replace landlords

Landlords are a cost inefficency. Profiteering and rent-seeking are not cool. Buildings can be democratically managed by their tenants (to form [Housing Cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_cooperative)).

The concept is comprised of the following components
- a "Zillow" interface to visualize rent prices
- a [B.I.M.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) simulator to estimate potential savings under a housing cooperative model
- a "Nextdoor" social media aspect to help tenants organize together and make collective demands

## Source Code Avaialability Diagram

map out all software with wireframes, rebuild all source code by observation (codepen-esque interface to do so), visualize code coverage.

The goal is to get to 100% source code reconstruction - open source by observation.

## UBI Simulator

a tool to visualize how we could redistribute current expenditures (military spending, etc.) to provide a universal basic income for all citizens.

data points:
- (p) number of citizens
- (c) existing spending ( $ / time unit )
- % of existing spending (c) to redirect to each citizen (p)
