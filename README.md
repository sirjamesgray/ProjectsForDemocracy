# ProjectsForLiberation

Projects for a more open society, participatory democracy, full transparency, etc. 

Liberation from what? It is clear that our so-called "democracies" are, in fact, oligarchal and coercive in nature. This repository will act as an index for projects that seek to build democratic people's power over private interest groups which rule our world. 

All projects live in [this trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/2pETMHrd/36f635f23f6a9c5b0e332175555aa64a/projects-for-liberation) before they are built on github.
